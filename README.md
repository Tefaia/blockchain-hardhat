Blockchain Network Marketplace, here's the functionality:


Faucet

• Purpose: Peer fund connection via MetaMask.

• Use Case: Allows new users to obtain initial funds to start interacting with the blockchain.

• Mechanism: Users must complete a predefined interaction within the marketplace, such as signing up, connecting to the marketplace network as a peer, and making an initial transaction to purchase an item. The 
  marketplace then receives the amount of cryptocurrency.


Miner

• Purpose: Validates transactions and adds them to the blockchain.

• Use Case: Ensures the integrity and security of the blockchain by validating transactions and creating new blocks.

• Reward: Miners receive cryptocurrency rewards (block rewards) for their efforts to create a new block using proof of work algorithm.


Wallet

• Purpose: Stores and manages users' cryptocurrency funds.

• Use Case: Enables users to send, receive, and monitor their cryptocurrency balances.


Blocks

• Purpose: Data structures that store a collection of transactions.

• Use Case: Group transactions into a single, immutable record that gets added to the blockchain.

• Components: Typically contain a header (with metadata like the previous block hash, timestamp, and nonce) and a list of transactions.


Block Explorer

• Purpose: A web interface to view the details of the blockchain.

• Use Case: Allows users to search for and view transactions, blocks, addresses, and other data on the blockchain.

• Features: Provides information such as transaction histories, block confirmations, and network status.


Peer

• Purpose: A Web interface to connect blockchain via websockets.

• Use Case: Allows peers to connect to peer network and notify other peers whenever a new block is added to the blockchain.



These components collectively enable a functioning blockchain-based marketplace by facilitating secure transactions, providing transparency, and ensuring the network's integrity and accessibility.

Synchronization in this Blockchain Project

1.Blockchain Node Synchronization

Full Node: My back-end is running a full node of the blockchain, it should continuously sync with the blockchain network to ensure it has the latest data.


Example Workflow

1. User Interaction:

- A user performs an action on the front-end (e.g., submitting a transaction).

2. Front-end to Back-end Communication:

- The front-end sends the transaction data to the back-end via an API call.

3. Back-end Processing:

- The back-end processes the transaction, submits it to the blockchain network, and updates its local state/database.

4. Back-end to Blockchain Sync:

- The back-end node syncs with the blockchain network, confirming the transaction is included in a new block.

5. Back-end to Front-end Update:

- Once confirmed, the back-end updates its state and pushes this update to the front-end.

- The front-end receives the update and refreshes the UI to reflect the new state.
